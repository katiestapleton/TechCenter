# Computer geek learning Computer Science. Ask for more info from me! Here are some of my coding assignments and projects completed during my education. When time permits, the files may be updated for better formatting, design, etc. At this time, I need to keep my focus on college classes. Afterall, I am only paying $1000s per college semester for an opportunity to work at your company.
